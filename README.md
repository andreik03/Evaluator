# Evaluator

The objective of this project is to make a website where a user can choose a problem to solve. They can upload their code and the code will be internally tested and checked for right output (evaluated), notifying the user if the code is correct. 

Examples of such websites: hackerrank.com, pbinfo.ro, infoarena.ro
